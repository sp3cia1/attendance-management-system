## Overview

This project is a web-based **Attendance Management System (AMS)** designed to address the challenges of traditional attendance methods, such as time-consuming manual systems and the issue of proxy attendance.  It offers a secure and efficient solution using **One-Time Password (OTP) authentication** and real-time tracking.

This system comprises two main interfaces:

*   **Teacher Interface:**  For teachers to initiate attendance sessions, generate OTPs, add students, and download attendance records.
*   **Student Interface:** For students to mark their attendance using their enrollment number and the current OTP.

This project was developed to solve a real-world problem faced in educational settings, aiming to improve the accuracy and speed of attendance tracking while preventing fraudulent attendance marking.

## Features

**Teacher Interface:**

*   **Start Attendance Session:** Teachers can initiate a timed attendance session with a 90-second countdown.
*   **OTP Generation:**  Generates a unique One-Time Password (OTP) stored securely in Firebase.
*   **Student Management:**  Allows teachers to add and manage student enrollment numbers.
*   **Real-time Attendance Tracking:** Displays a list of students who have marked their attendance in real-time.
*   **Attendance Data Export:**  Enables teachers to download attendance records in CSV format.
*   **Session Control:** Features to reset and start new attendance sessions.

**Student Interface:**

*   **Enrollment Number Input:** Students enter their enrollment number to identify themselves.
*   **OTP Verification:** Students must enter the correct OTP generated by the teacher to mark attendance.
*   **Countdown Timer Display:**  Shows the remaining time for the attendance session, emphasizing the time-sensitive nature of OTP validity.
*   **Tab-Switching Prevention:** Implements browser tab-switching detection to prevent students from leaving the attendance page before marking attendance, mitigating OTP sharing.
*   **Session Expiry Handling:**  Clearly indicates when the attendance session has expired.
